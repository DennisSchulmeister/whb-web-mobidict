Short description
-----------------

A mobile-friendly online dictionary. This is an examination in web development
for my master studie at Wilhelm-Büchner-Hochschule, Germany.

**TODO: Screenshots**

This is a real app, that is realy working. :-) Use the following commands to
set up a node.js environment and start the server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the server listens on port 8888. Use the environment variables
shown in the start-up message to change the defaults.

This programm requires `grep` on your machine to query the dictionary file.
So far, it has only been tested on Linux. Do yourself a favour. Don't use
anything less. :-)
